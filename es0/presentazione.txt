Hello there!

 My name is Sandra and I am an undergrad student of International Law.
 I got into the tech world few months ago, in November 2021, by learning about HTML and CSS.
 My entry into the world of programming was purely out of curiosity but as I got deeper into the
 various programming languages, I became enthusiastic. I wanted to learn more and all that I could.

 This zeal is what is bringing me to pursue an opportunity of a career, possibly as a full stack developer.

 One has to start from somewhere right? :(
